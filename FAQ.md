## Are you interested in selling Minimalist
A couple times a year I get contacted by people asking if I'm interested in selling Minimalist. I've obviously turned down these offers and I thought I'd answer publicly for disclosure and to give me something to link them to.

If I had to give one reason: I don't need the money. So I have the luxury of doing what's right for my product and my users and and not having to worry about whether it's right for me.

So what would they be buying? It's certainly not the codebase, that's all open source and provided for reuse and redistribution under GNU GPL v3. Likewise, it wouldn't be just to continue development and get credit for it. I give credit to my contributors in the changelog, release notes, and on the About page in the extension.

They would be buying the brand and the users.

**The brand**
Obviously brands are bought and sold all the time (both literally and figuratively). Once you sell your brand in any way, there is no un-selling it. I would only do that if I really had to.

**The users**
Selling your users is about the worst thing a company can do. My users have put a lot of trust in me by installing Minimalist. Someone buying Minimalist would be buying pre-approved permission to access the browsing data of 100k+ users. I don't use those permissions maliciously, Minimalist needs them to do what it does; but they could be used to steal passwords, credit cards, etc and users would never know unless they read the code. I wouldn't risk betraying the trust of a single user this way, let alone 100k.
