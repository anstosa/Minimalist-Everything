## Information you provide

**Modules.** Configuration and script data you enter or import into Minimalist. This information is stored locally on your machine and is never transmitted.

## Other browsing data

Minimalist requests a broad set of permissions that are unfortunately required for it to function. Those permissions are used for the sole purpose of detecting pages targetted by modules and injecting the requested code into those page.

Minimalist never records, collects, or transmits user behavior data on third party sites.

## Third party modules

Minimalist allows for the import of third party modules. Those modules may be able to do almost anything in your browser including, but not limited to, stealing account credentials and transmitting them to a malicious author.

You should never install modules from untrusted sources and Minimalist is not liable for any harm done by third party modules.

## Information we may share

Minimalist uses Google Analytics for basic usage tracking. Extremely limited user data like page loads is collected only on extension owned pages: the options page and the browser button popup.

No other type of information is ever sent to a third party.

Other instances where Minimalist may need to share your data

To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
To enforce applicable Terms, including investigation of potential violations.
To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
To protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Signal, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

## Updates

We will update this privacy policy as needed so that it is current, accurate, and as clear as possible. Your continued use of the extension confirms your acceptance of any updates to the Privacy Policy.
